WSDM (pronounced 'wisdom') is one of the premier conferences on web inspired research involving search and data mining.")
st.markdown("The glory days of Radio DJs have passed, and musical gatekeepers have been replaced with personalizing algorithms and unlimited streaming services. With easy access to various kinds of music across the globe, public is now listening to all kinds of music. Existing algorithms, however, struggle in key areas. Without enough historical data, how would an algorithm know if listeners will like a new song or a new artist? And how would it know what songs to recommend brand new users?")
st.markdown("The dataset is from KKBOX, Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. The input contains text data only, and no audio features. They currently use a collaborative filtering based algorithm with matrix factorization and word embedding in their recommendation system but believe new techniques could lead to better results.")

The objective is to make prediction on whether a user will re-listen to a song or not. Broadly, it is a music recommendation problem (ROC-AUC Score as per Kaggle Challenge Evaluation Metric).")
